(Most) Pure Nitrogen is a fractional distillation (Fractional Distillation - The separation of a mixture into component parts) of liquid air. 
Nitrogen is a gas (Under normal circumstances, colorless, tasteless odorless)
Boils at 77k and freezes at 63k

Liquid Nitrogen is an inexpensive coolant
More than the 20 million tons of Nitrogen over every square mile
Nitrogen is mostly unreactive, due to its triple bond to the Nitrogen atoms. 
Some bacteria is able to synthesize Nitrogen compounds using atmospheric Nitrogen   . 
One form of synthesizing Nitrogen is Nitrogen Fixation (Nitrogen Fixation - Where Nitrogen is converted to ammonia)

    <h1>Is Nitrogen dangerous?</h1>
        <p> Nitrogen is dangerous if inhaled in large quantities, the cause of death has been so commonplace that it has been given the name Nitrogen Asphyxiation. Nitrogen, as stated before, only dangerous in large doses, and is perfectly harmless when mixed with a certain amount of Oxygen. Nitrogen is not poisonous however, what makes it harmful is the displacement of Oxygen that takes place. There are serious risks to being in an Oxygen depleted/Nitrogen Enriched Atmosphere are unconsciousness from only one or two breaths.</p>

    <h1>How abundant is it on Earth? </h1>
        <p>The pie chart displayed below is the amount in the air, so there is a lot of Nitrogen around. Nitrogen is an extremely abundant, with it making up most of our atmosphere, it can almost literally be pulled from the air, as Nitrogen occurs naturally in the atmosphere.It is in all living organisms from DNA of plant life, to the very DNA in a Human. It is approximated that there is more than the 20 million tons of Nitrogen over every square mile. It is also renewable, with things such as the Nitrogen cycle. When a living things die, decomposers such as fungi, return the Nitrogen into the soil which goes into the plants, and the new animals eat the plants, and the cycle continues.

    <h1>How is it Isolated or processed... </h1>
        <p>There are many uses for Nitrogen, from the liquid form that used as a coolant for cosmetic and instant refrigeration of foods in restaurants, to its use in advanced fertilization of plants.  It has a great economic impact on the world today. Since it is an extremely abundant element, all of the forms of it are plentiful and cheap. The liquid form of nitrogen is priced at the low cost of 50 cents, to about 2 dollars. There are many other forms of Nitrogen as well, such as its gaseous form, that is isolated by taking liquid air and boiling it, to where this causes the the liquid Oxygen and the Gaseous Nitrogen to separate, and this you can isolate the gas.

    <h1>What if Nitrogen disappeared overnight?</h1>
        <p>Some theories include that many to all life on Earth would suffer greatly due to the loss. The fact that without Nitrogen, which is in all life, plant and animal, the DNA and the RNA of every life form on Earth, their/our DNA would almost literally fall apart. There would be many different effects on the planet and its inhabitants, another catastrophic event that could/would happen is that since most of the atmosphere is Nitrogen, about 79 percent, if all of that were to go away, then fires would be more commonplace due to there not being any dampener of Nitrogen, the Oxygen would almost be like never ending fuel, the fire could breathe.</p>

        <h1>What if Nitrogen PT 2.</h1>
        <p>  The planet would also be extremely warmer due to the lack of an Atmosphere, the protective layer that saves us from UV rays, which in turn would cause evaporation of water to accelerate, then there would be no water in this already hot landscape, causing all life on Earth to die from either dehydration or heat in in general. Nitrogen is a necessity.</p>

    <h1>History and Other Facts</h1>
        <p>Daniel Rutherford was the first to consider Nitrogen as an element, but he was not the first one to actually use the element or discover it. The earliest form of Nitrogen was found in Egypt by “alchemist” in the form of “Sal Ammonia,” and this was found by the alchemist heating dung, urine, and salt. 
        “Pure” Nitrogen Gas was founded by two chemist in the 1760s by the name of Henry Cavendish, and Joseph Priestley.They removed the Oxygen in the air in a controlled environment. The two conducted experiments with the newly found gas, some of their most notable findings were that it could extinguish the flame of a candle, and a mouse that had breathed it in, would die shortly after.  Daniel Rutherford was the one in September of 1772, in his doctoral thesis, at Edinburgh, Scotland. Rutherford is now credited with the founding of the Element known as Nitrogen.   </p>
