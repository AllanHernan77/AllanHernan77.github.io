	<h1 class="headertext">Is Nitrogen Dangerous PT 2.</h1>
    <hr>
		<p>There are more dangers in liquid nitrogen, liquid nitrogen is an extremely cold substance, so if anything gets on your skin, it could result in either frostbite, and/or cold burns, and if it gets introduced into the eyes, it could result into permanent eye damage. Another danger with almost any Nitrogen could be pressurized, and could be explosive to some degree if warmed. There are a couple safety equipment that is recommended, such as Thermal or Leather loose fitting gloves, they should be loose fitting because it if liquid nitrogen should fall into the gloves, closed toe shoes, and cuffed pants.

	<h1 class="headertext">Future Concerns</h1>
    <hr>
		<p>There should be no future concerns of it running out, or getting it even at a cheaper price, as right now (Liquid) Nitrogen is about 50 cents to 2 dollars per gallon in bulk. The only concern that is worth mentioning is the fact that fertilizers or nitrogen in general, if used excessively, can cause harm to the ecosystem. The problem with excessive Nitrogen in the ecosystem is the fact that the excess is brought into rivers and streams, which causes the final destination of said river or stream can make eutrophication happen which according to the NOAA causes “an explosive growth of algae (algal blooms) that depletes the water of oxygen when the the algae die and are eaten by bacteria.” This lack of Oxygen can make the water Hypoxic, deprived of Oxygen, or Anoxic, completely devoid of Oxygen. This can kill the fish in the water, which can cause a chain reaction of animal death, or if an animal drinks it, it can make them extremely ill or lead to death. It is not a major concern now, but if not looked into can cause major disasters down the road.

	 <div  class="ThirdBox">
	<h1 class="headertext"> What properties of the element makes it special/essential for life? 
</h1>
    <hr>
		<p>Nitrogen is a special element that has a strong triple bond, which is said to be hard to break. What really makes it special however is when it is converted into Ammonia. Ammonia is the chemical compound of Nitrogen and Hydrogen, (NH3), and is one of the key components for rocket fuel. Other than its compounds, Nitrogen is in amino acids, which are the “building blocks” of life, aka DNA. Nitrogen is also a key component of proteins and enzymes, proteins promote muscle build up and enzymes give living things energy to do everyday things, and these everyday things include digesting food, which is an essential part of staying alive.  </p>

		 <div  class="Fourthbox">
	<h1 class="headertext"> What types of important compounds does it form with essential elements?
</h1>
    <hr>
		<p>There are many important chemicals that contain Nitrogen and the other essential elements, from the highly produced Ammonia, which is the catalyst to many compounds, and   used for fertilizers, which is one of the only reasons crops have been able to keep up with the growing populus, to Hydrazine, which  is essentially rocket fuel, which helps us explore our solar system. Urea is another important compound that is used with Nitrogen and other essential elements. Urea (C-H4-N2-O)is the Nitrogen in most fertilizers, which is used to keep crops growing strong, in most soils. Hydrogen Cyanide (HCN) is a strong, and poisonous gas that is used for fumigation, and it is extremely important to help keep pest at bay. Nitric Acid is the other catalyst and is highly marketed. Nitric Acid is used to make dyes, fertilizers, drugs, and even explosives. There are many important compounds that involve Nitrogen.
