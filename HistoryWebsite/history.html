		<h1 class="DAMNALBUM"> Music</h1>
	<p class="textman">The Jazz Age of music first originated from the south of the USA, expanding from the blues and ragtime music of black people. More specifically, emerged in New orleans, as Jazz blended with a variety of music including "African and African American, religious, brass band, and blues styles" (Movies, Music, and Sports of the 1920's). As jazz popularity grew, so did ways to censor it by the means of calling it,  "devil's music"(citation), Jazz was much more rhythmic and sexy, and it was easy to dance to. 

</p> 


		<p class="textman"> With that, young Americans with the new Jazz influence are now being chastised by their elders for a number of violations against decency, including using slang, dancing low-class dances, and enjoying music with African American influences (Dance in the Jazz Age). Finally a number of black musicians like Louis Armstrong and Bessie smith had a influence in this influence musical genre.

 			<h1 class="DAMNALBUM">Radio & News</h1>		
 		<p class="textman">Dating back to the 1900s,  Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi succeeded in transmitting the first radio broadcast (PBS) and Edwin Armstrong then invented a circuit that could then transfer voice or music long range. With that, the cheap entertainment approach of watching the cinema, the radio was the most abundant technology set out to 50 million American people (BBC). 
</p> 


		<p class="textman">
Not only was the radio a way to bring the family close together, but was implemented and became a mean of making money. For example,  radio equipment generated 12 million in 1921, to 842 million in 1929. In addition radio corporations  like NBC and CBS sold advertisements from movie stars, musicians and singers to advertise products and appear on shows (PBS).

 			<h1 class="DAMNALBUM">Movie</h1>		
 		<p class="textman">Because the economic boom during the Roaring Twenties,more people had the opportunity to spend time on leisure activities. With that, the America people fell in love with the cheap alternative form of entertainment: Movies. Silent, and black and white movies came to production in the 1920s, and in 1927, the first "talkie" or talking picture was made (Khan Academy). Incorporating sound to movies through a Vitaphone (musical tracks in visual tracks) provided a technological advancement and innovated the way entertainment, more specifically movies were portrayed (Alchin)
</p> 


		<p class="textman"> By 1929, 25,00 cinemas were constructed and an average of "100 million americans" on a weekly basis (Alchin). Because the production of movies were growing, there needed to be a ideal climate and location for outdoor filming, so around the 1920s Hollywood was situated in Los Angeles. Furthermore, the Hollywood sign would originally be built as "Hollywoodland. It was built by Harry Chandler in 1923 and now has became an American cultural icon (Alchin).

 		<p class="textman">Finally, all of these topics had an effect on the social life of everyone. Slaves moved from the south to the north mostly populating Harlem, New York. There industrial jobs opened for a lot of people leading them to work more in cities than farms. African Americans were able to get along with whites because of Jazz music. Everyone evolved into a generation that could cooperate together and work side by side.  </p>
