	<h1>Why did I choose Nextech?</h1>
		<p>I have always wanted to pursue a career in the tech field. However I really have not got the push needed to get on that path. I have little to no experience coding, and general information on computers is somewhat limited. Nextech is doing more than giving me a push, but launching me to a path of what I dreamed of wanting to do. That being showing my creative appoarch, and displaying it on a screen thorugh pixels means a lot to me!</p>

        <div  class="SecondBox">
    <h1>Goals after High School.</h1>
        <p>After graduating High School, I plan on attending UIndy where I would get my bachelors in Software Development. This is a great ambition for me, as in my family little have went to college yet even graduated High School. I also want to play College Basketball, it might come off as difficult but I plan on to train towards that goal.</p>
    </div>


        <div  class="ThirdBox">
    <h1>Goals for my Career.</h1>
        <p>For what job I might go for, is still a blurry for me. I always wanted to go for video game development, seems how I  always had an intrest in video games. However any type of specialized devlopment can go as long as it involves a creative aspect. I also want to blend video editing/production in my life still, as I always have fun doing videos now!</p>
